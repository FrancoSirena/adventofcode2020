# Advent of Code 2020

My advent of code resolutions.
All folders follow the same pattern where we have:
- [day]: folder name
- [day].js: the actual code
- [day].input: the input to be processed
- [day]-sample.input: the sample input to verify the base scenario

All code will run by
`node [day]\[day].js` 

They all output the results in a similar fashion:
```js
  1 $ <result>
  2 $ <result>
```

## --- Day 2: Password Philosophy ---

## --- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---
